2. Enter the first sliding doors (unlocked)
3. Walk to the two badge-readers on the far wall. Use your [[BMC EMS Badge]] on the **right** badge reader to open the second door.
4. Proceed through the second sliding door. Door frequently breaks - if door does not move after light turns green, consider gently sliding door open manually. Door will typically close automatically even after being slid open manually.

7. Proceed across the skybridge to the main building ([[BMC Menino Building]]).
