## Directions
### Emergencies
Use the [[BMC ER Entrance]].

### Non-Emergent [[BMC Emergency Room|ER]]/Psych Transfers
You may use the [[BMC ER Entrance]].
Note that many of the spots have concrete parking stop blocks that prevent vans from properly backing in.

If there are few remaining spots for incoming 911 crews (or your van does not fit in the spots with stop blocks), consider accessing the ER via the [[BMC Non-Emergent Ambulance Entrance]] ([[BMC EMS Badge|BMC Badge]] required).

### [[BMC Shapiro Building|Shapiro Building]]
Drive directly to the Shapiro Building - no access directly from the rest of the hospital.

### All Other Floors
If you have a [[BMC EMS Badge|BMC Badge]], use the [[BMC Non-Emergent Ambulance Entrance]].
Otherwise, use the [[BMC ER Entrance]].
